Create a homepage that displays numbers 1 - 4, each with a different background color. On clicking any number, it should jump to a nested list to display travel destinations (e.g., Europe â€“ France, Italy, Greece - Ordered list) and subcategories (e.g., Paris, Rome, Athens - Unordered list). Similarly for other numbers.

Create a table that lists 3 travel destinations in left column and images of associated attractions in right column (e.g., Paris- Eiffel tower, Rome- Colosseum, New York- Statue of Liberty). On clicking the attraction, it should jump to bottom of the page with related information.
