        <h2>Eiffel Tower</h2>
        <p>
          When the French government was organizing the International Exposition
          of 1889 to celebrate the centenary of the French Revolution, a
          competition was held for designs for a suitable monument. More than
          100 plans were submitted, and the Centennial Committee accepted that
          of the noted bridge engineer Gustave Eiffel. Eiffel’s concept of a
          300-meter (984-foot) tower built almost entirely of open-lattice
          wrought iron aroused amazement, skepticism, and no little opposition
          on aesthetic grounds. When completed, the tower served as the entrance
          gateway to the exposition. Nothing remotely like the Eiffel Tower had
          ever been built; it was twice as high as the dome of St. Peter’s in
          Rome or the Great Pyramid of Giza. In contrast to such older
          monuments, the tower was erected in only about two years (1887–89),
          with a small labor force, at slight cost. Making use of his advanced
          knowledge of the behavior of metal arch and metal truss forms under
          loading, Eiffel designed a light, airy, but strong structure that
          presaged a revolution in civil engineering and architectural design.
          And, after it opened to the public on May 15, 1889, it ultimately
          vindicated itself aesthetically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on the season, the Eiffel Tower can be up to seven inches
          taller or six inches shorter. During hotter months, over 104 degrees
          Fahrenheit, to be exact, the iron expands and causes the tower to be
          about seven inches taller. In colder temperatures, the iron contracts
          and shortens the tower by about six inches.

        <h2>Colleseum</h2>
        <p>
          At the Colosseum’s major events – often those organised and paid for
          by the emperors themselves – there was no entry fee. And free food was
          sometimes served, too. Bonus! Emperors would use this as a way to gain
          popularity and support from the public. The event at the Colosseum
          were seriously brutal, though – during certain games held by the
          emperors around 10,000 animals were killed in a single day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The giant amphitheater was built in Rome under the Flavian emperors.
          Construction of the Colosseum was begun sometime between 70 and 72 CE
          during the reign of Vespasian. It is located just east of the Palatine
          Hill, on the grounds of what was Nero’s Golden House. The artificial
          lake that was the centerpiece of that palace complex was drained, and
          the Colosseum was sited there, a decision that was as much symbolic as
          it was practical. Vespasian, whose path to the throne had relatively
          humble beginnings, chose to replace the tyrannical emperor’s private
          lake with a public amphitheater that could host tens of thousands of
          Romans. The structure was officially dedicated in 80 CE by Titus in a
          ceremony that included 100 days of games. Later, in 82 CE, Domitian
          completed the work by adding the uppermost story. Unlike earlier
          amphitheaters, which were nearly all dug into convenient hillsides for
          extra support, the Colosseum is a freestanding structure of stone and
          concrete, using a complex system of barrel vaults and groin vaults and
          measuring 620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 meters) overall. Three of the
          arena’s stories are encircled by arcades framed on the exterior by
          engaged columns in the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders; the
          structure’s rising arrangement of columns became the basis of the
          Renaissance codification known as the assemblage of orders.

        <h2>Statue of Liberty</h2>
        <p>
          The Statue of Liberty stands in Upper New York Bay, a universal symbol
          of freedom. Originally conceived as an emblem of the friendship
          between the people of France and the U.S. and a sign of their mutual
          desire for liberty, it was also meant to celebrate the abolition of
          slavery following the U.S. Civil War. Over the years the Statue has
          become much more. It is the Mother of Exiles, greeting millions of
          immigrants and embodying hope and opportunity for those seeking a
          better life in America. It stirs the desire for freedom in people all
          over the world. It represents the United States itself.

          Statue of Liberty, colossal statue on Liberty Island in the Upper New
          York Bay, U.S., commemorating the friendship of the peoples of the
          United States and France. Standing 305 feet (93 metres) high including
          its pedestal, it represents a woman holding a torch in her raised
          right hand and a tablet bearing the adoption date of the Declaration
          of Independence (July 4, 1776) in her left. The torch, which measures
          29 feet (8.8 metres) from the flame tip to the bottom of the handle,
          is accessible via a 42-foot (12.8-metre) service ladder inside the arm
          (this ascent was open to the public from 1886 to 1916). An elevator
          carries visitors to the observation deck in the pedestal, which may
          also be reached by stairway, and a spiral staircase leads to an
          observation platform in the figure’s crown. A plaque at the pedestal’s
          entrance is inscribed with a sonnet, “The New Colossus” (1883) by Emma
          Lazarus.
